          An Introduction

        <p className="font-redhat text-xl font-light">
          Iâ€™m currently a student at Vanderbilt University majoring in Computer
          Science + Economics and minoring in Engineering Management. My
          previous experience in software engineering has led me to the world of
          user experience and product design, where I have becoming increasingly
          motivated to solve problems by designing practical and human-centered
          solutions. I enjoy the challenge of understanding users and helping
          them improve their lives with intentional design and problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p className="font-redhat text-xl font-light">
          In my free time, I enjoy playing table tennis, going to concerts, and
          eating tasty food.
