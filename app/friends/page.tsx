              organization that provides day programs for adults with
              disabilities. Working on this project as part of Vanderbiltâ€™s
              student developer group, ChangePlusPlus, was my first experience
              being part of a dedicated team of developers to make a real
              impact. We developed an attendance tracking app for Friends Life,
              and the process of software development inspired me to pursue UX
              and Product Management as a career."

              solution for attendance tracking, plus it cost them a lot of

Further, I had my first experience working in a large team of software developers, which has given me insight into how products are built from a technical standpoint, and how stakeholder requirements are translated into actionable steps for software developers.",
          "However, my biggest takeaway from working with Friends Life has been understanding what I am most passionate about: designing user experiences. Understanding how developing software can improve the lives of helpers at Friends Life has encouraged me to learn more about what makes a product successful and impactful while also leading me to think about how our current design could be improved upon. Working on this project has also given me the technical expertise to pursue more advanced projects framed in a human-centered lens.",
